3. Start the development server:
   
   npm run dev
   

## Environment Variables

1. In the Backend directory, create a .env file:
   
   touch .env
   

2. Open the .env file and add the necessary environment variables. For example:
   
   PORT=8000
   MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   

   Adjust these variables according to your specific project needs.

## Running the Application
